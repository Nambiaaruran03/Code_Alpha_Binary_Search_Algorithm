# Code_Alpha_Binary_Search_Algorithm
This Python code combines two functionalities: number generation and binary search. It allows users to generate a range of numbers starting from 0 with a specified step and then perform a binary search on that range.

Functionality:

Number Generation:

The generate_range function generates a list of numbers within a specified range.
It takes three parameters: start, end, and step (defaulting to 2).
The function creates a list of numbers that starts at start, increments by step, and continues until reaching or exceeding the end.
The generated range is displayed to the user.
Binary Search:

The binary_search function performs binary search on a given list.
It takes two parameters: arr (the list to search) and target (the number to find).
The function searches for the target within the arr and returns the index if found or -1 if not found.
The result of the binary search is displayed to the user.
